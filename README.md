# Snake

snake but rendered with vulkan in rust   
made it in around 6 hours so logic is a bit dodgy(try to tap keys)

is the renderer the best? no.  
is it blazingly fast? maybe.  
do i know how most of the vulkan stuff works? yesnt  
does it work tho? yesâ„¢  

[heres another snake](https://github.com/cezarhg123/snake-in-rust) that i made in a week(after learning rust for 2 days). while the code is weird, its more polished gameplay wise
